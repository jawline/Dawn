/* RFS is the name I gave to the internal temporary filesystem used by the OS which other filesystems are bound to
   the name stood for root FS, though its not just for the root file system any more, there seems to be no real reason to change the name
   RFS is only a simple VFS implementation that allows the creation of temporary directory structures by the OS for organizational purposes
   (And the binding of all file systems together), do not overestimate its capabilities...
