On modern processors (The type for which this OS is being designed) there are two types of memory. Virtual and Physical.
With virtual memory all physical addresses have to be mapped to a virtual address, the advantages of this are that code
can be executed at any physical location, even if it requires to be executed at address 0x1000. Virtual memory managment
in SimpleOS is done in mm/virt_mm.h and mm/virt_mm.c.

//TODO, Elaborate on types of virtual memory (Paged, Segmented) why segmentation sucks and go into more detail about how virtual memory is useful
