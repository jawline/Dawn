 * @section WhatIsADevelopmentModel What is a development model?
 *A development model is, put simply, a model around which you structure the planning of a project. For example, the typical way people plan their project, starting with Planning, going on to research their chosen field then testing any theories or ideas they may have then finishing by summarizing the entire project in a conclusion could be seen one type of development model as at each stage in the project the person doing the work will have a clear idea of their purpose.

 * @section TheSimpleOSWay The SimpleOS development model
 *
 *For this operating system project I have decided to use a circular development model. This is a iterative release model, in which a set of features are planned out for the next release. These features are then researched and if they are feasible at the current point in the project algorithms are designed about how the SimpleOS implementation should work. These algorithms are then implemented in code. At which point the system is tested and bugs are found and fixed. The cycle then begins again from the features planning stage. This development model is particularly suited to a road map style plan, which doesn’t outline the project as a whole in a single block, and instead outlines how the project should progress with each iteration, the road map suits this development model because it can easily be adapted to a change in the short term plan while still leaving a project with the same set of features at the end – you can view the road map for SimpleOS on this wiki.

 * @section WhyThatWay Why?
 * The circular development model is particularly suited to this project for several reasons. One is that the scale of the project is huge, and to hope to complete a entire operating system with a full planned feature set with limited time and ability is simply a unachievable aim, the circular model however allows for each release to build on the last, allowing the programmer (me) to achieve all they can with limited resources and without getting overwhelmed by the scale of the project. Another reason why it is beneficial over the more linear planning methods is that it allows for the features of each release within the cycle to be changed easily without too much disruption to the master plan.
